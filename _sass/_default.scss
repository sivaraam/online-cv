/*
 * Responsiveness in the site used by wkhtmltopdf to generate the PDF
 * results in the PDF always being generated for the mobile version
 * of the page. That occupies a lot of space and makes the resume too
 * long.
 *
 * So, turn off responsiveness to generate a PDF of the desktop version of
 * the site.
 *
 * FIXME: See if you could find why the mobile version is being used and
 * fix it.
