It was made into a Jekyll Theme by @sharu725.
Styling using Sass was done by @nelsonmestevao. Thanks a lot!
[A new theme](https://github.com/sivaraam/online-cv/commit/72cee73e056adeb82358ca6b84f2aa9cfcd84988)
that suits the tastes of @sivaraam was added and used to create his resume.

## PDF Generation
A PDF version of the resume could be created using [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/).
The steps to generate the PDF are as follows:

```
online-cv $ ./generate-pdf
```

That's it. It should do the trick.
